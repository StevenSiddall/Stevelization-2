# Stevelization-2

This is a personal project in which I try to create my own version of a Civilization-style game using the Unity Engine. A large portion of the base code (hex tiles, terrain generation, mouse controls, etc.) has been written with some modification by following along with the "Mostly Civilized" tutorial series by quill18 on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-rCuN7uMR8&list=PLbghT7MmckI7JHf0pdEQ8fbPb-LoDXEno&index=1).
